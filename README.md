## Introduction
Due to the lack of appropriate preparedness and response plans, many healthcare providers in the US experienced a severe shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Inadequate PPE threatens the safety of frontline medical staff and negatively impacts the quality of care. The level of preparedness to combat unprecedented outbreaks directly depends on proactive planning, strategic thinking, and demand forecasting. 

Massachusetts General Hospital (Mass General) is the oldest and largest teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School and the third-oldest general hospital in the US, with a capacity of 999 beds. 

## Objective 
Reduce average PPE storage while maintaining a satisfaction rate (98%) by adjusting PPE quantity per order and reorder points. COVID-19 patient data are retrieved from https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u
